Move the site to a different hostname.

    python _build/set_domain.py thevalleyvenues.com
    python _build/set_domain.py thevalley.sparkmedia.ai

Two files know the site's address and they have to agree: BASE in build.py,
which is written into every og:url and og:image, and CNAME, which is what
GitHub Pages serves the site as. Getting one and not the other gives you a
site that loads fine and previews, in every message anybody pastes it into,
under its old name.

So this changes both, rebuilds, and checks the result. It does not touch DNS
and it does not touch URL_ROOT -- the site is written for a domain root and
every internal link is already relative to one.
